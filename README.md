# polymer-table

See [live demo here](http://less.azurewebsites.net/stocks.html). Please use Chrome, Safari or Opera only.

This little app illustrates that one can write a usefull app by using polymer 1.7 to create a custom tag in vanilla html, javascript and css, without having to install anything!
A dumb terminal plus vi would do the job. There's no need to have a fancy IDE or
a whole slew of things such as nested node_modules, JSX, ES6, Typescript, webpack, Sass, Babel, Browserify, Gulp or Flux.
